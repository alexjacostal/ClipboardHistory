Version 2.0 has some major changes under the cover but still maintains the exact same look and feel.

Remember that your feedback is very important to me! Keep it coming.

Here is the list of changes that are worthy of mention.

1. Visual Studio 2015 Support. (here you go PeterVdBoogaard)
2. Improved installation process. No more windows installer.
3. You can now remove items from the History list with the Delete key or Button. (proposed by vijayk on msdn) Thanks!
4. Added option to Display time stamps or not. (proposed by tedypranolo on github) Thanks!
5. Resolved a color brush issue that could hide text with custom themes.
