# Clipboard History

ClipboardHistory is a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>
extension that enables clipboard history.

It keeps track of all changes to the clipboard in a configurable list using a tool window.
You can then navigate the list to retrieve the desired clipboard data.

I developed this extension for my own needs, feel free to contribute if you can improve it.
